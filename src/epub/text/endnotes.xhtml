					<p>I cannot avoid subjoining in a note a succeeding paragraph of Scott’s letter, which, though it does not relate to the main subject of our correspondence, was too characteristic to be omitted. Some time previously I had sent Miss Sophia Scott small duodecimo <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">American</span> editions of her father’s poems published in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Edinburgh</span> in quarto volumes; showing the “nigromancy” of the <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">American</span> press, by which a quart of wine is conjured into a pint bottle. Scott observes: “In my hurry, I have not thanked you in Sophia’s name for the kind attention which furnished her with the <span epub:type="z3998:nationality">American</span> volumes. I am not quite sure I can add my own, since you have made her acquainted with much more of papa’s folly than she would ever otherwise have learned; for I had taken special care they should never see any of those things during their earlier years. I think I have told you that Walter is sweeping the firmament with a feather like a maypole and indenting the pavement with a sword like a scythe⁠—in other words, he has become a whiskered hussar in the 18th Dragoons.” <a href="../text/preface.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>An error in the foregoing inscription has been corrected by the venerable Stowe. “Whereas,” saith he, “it hath been far spread abroad by vulgar opinion, that the rebel smitten down so manfully by Sir William Walworth, the then worthy Lord Maior, was named Jack Straw, and not Wat Tyler, I thought good to reconcile this rash-conceived doubt by such testimony as I find in ancient and good records. The principal leaders, or captains, of the commons, were Wat Tyler, as the first man; the second was John, or Jack, Straw,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr>⁠ <cite>Stowe’s London</cite>. <a href="../text/the-boars-head-tavern-eastcheap.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>As this inscription is rife with excellent morality, I transcribe it for the admonition of delinquent tapsters. It is no doubt, the production of some choice spirit who once frequented the Boar’s Head.</p>
